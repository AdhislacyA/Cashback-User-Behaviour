# Cashback User Behaviour Analysis
This repository contains SQL queries and Python scripts used to analyze shopper engagements, offer redemption, and customer behaviour for a cashback-based shopping platiform. Part of the analysis (CashbackUserBehaviour_DBC) was initially performed using Databricks (Community Edition) with a focus on user behaviour, conversion funnel, and retention insights. 
âš  NOTE: The original dataset used for this analysis is confidential and not included in this repository.
Users can replace it with their own dataset in CSV format, and upload the file paths accordingly.
