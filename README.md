# Cashback User Behaviour Analysis
This repository contains SQL queries and Python scripts used to analyze shopper engagements, offer redemption, and customer behaviour for a cashback-based shopping platiform. Part of the analysis (CashbackUserBehaviour_DBC) was initially performed using Databricks (Community Edition) with a focus on user behaviour, conversion funnel, and retention insights. 
### âš  NOTE: Sample Dataset Included
The original dataset used for this analysis is confidential and **not included** in this repository.
A **sample dataset** ('engagements.csv', 'offers.csv', 'shopper_offers.csv', 'sample_shoppers.csv') has been provided so that users can test the analysis scripts.
Users can replace it with their own dataset in CSV format, and upload the file paths accordingly.
